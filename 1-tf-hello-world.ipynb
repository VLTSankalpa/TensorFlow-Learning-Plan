In the case of creating neural networks, one simple case is where it learns the relationship between two numbers. So, for example, if you were writing code for a function like this, you already know the 'rules':\n","\n","\n","```\n","def hw_function(x):\n","    y = (2 * x) - 1\n","    return y\n","```\n","\n","So how would you train a neural network to do the equivalent task? By using data! By feeding it with a set of x's and y's, it should be able to figure out the relationship between them.\n","\n","This is obviously a very different paradigm from what you might be used to. So let's step through it piece by piece.\n","\n","This program is a basic introduction to machine learning using the TensorFlow library in Python.
